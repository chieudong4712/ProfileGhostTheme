### Troubleshooting

###### The Browse Posts link isn't working

If you're having trouble with the browse posts link not working make sure you're using the currect URL for your environment in your Ghost config.js file. I.e. if your Ghost site is being served on http://your-site-name.com make sure you use exactly that URL in your config.js file and not for example http://www.your-site-name.com
